# vision-transformer-various-trials
- I have tried image classification by training ViT models by small dataset cifar10 and cifar100 for ViT models, and also have compared with ResNet faminly model as baseline.
- **ViT related/family models** covered here are:
  - **ViT**
  - **SwinTransformer**

  - **CaiT**
    - https://github.com/lucidrains/vit-pytorch/blob/main/vit_pytorch/cait.py
  - **ConvMixer**
  - **MLPMixer**
    - https://github.com/lucidrains/mlp-mixer-pytorch/blob/main/mlp_mixer_pytorch/mlp_mixer_pytorch.py
- see for training scripts for 'vit.py' under 'src' folder.
